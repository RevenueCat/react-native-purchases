The first release candidate of **RevenueCat Purchases React Native v6** is here!! ðŸ˜»

This latest release updates the Android SDK dependency from v5 to [v6](https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-android/releases/tag/6.0.0) to use BillingClient 5. This version of BillingClient brings an entire new subscription model which has resulted in large changes across the entire SDK.

### Migration Guides
- See [Android Native - 5.x to 6.x Migration](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/android-native-5x-to-6x-migration) for a
  more thorough explanation of the new Google subscription model announced with BillingClient 5 and how to take
  advantage of it in V6. This guide includes tips on product setup with the new model.

### New `SubscriptionOption` concept

#### Purchasing
In v5, a Google Play Android `Package` or `StoreProduct` represented a single purchaseable entity, and free trials or intro
offers would automatically be applied to the purchase if the user was eligible.

Now, in React Native v6, an Google Play Android `Package` or `StoreProduct` represents a duration of a subscription and contains all the ways to
purchase that duration -- any offers and its base plan. Each of these purchase options are `SubscriptionOption`s.
When passing a `Package` to `purchasePackage()` or `StoreProduct` to `purchaseStoreProduct()`, the SDK will use the following logic to choose which
`SubscriptionOption` to purchase:
- Filters out offers with "rc-ignore-offer" tag
- Uses `SubscriptionOption` with the longest free trial or cheapest first phase
    - Only offers the user is eligible will be applied
- Falls back to base plan

For more control, purchase subscription options with the new `purchaseSubscriptionOption()` method.

#### Models

`StoreProduct` now has a few new properties use for Google Play Android:
- `defaultOption`
  - A subscription option that will automatically be applie when purchasing a `Package` or `StoreProduct`
- `subscriptionOptions`
  - A list of subscription options (could be null)

### Observer Mode

Observer mode is still supported in v6. Other than updating the SDK version, there are no changes required.
