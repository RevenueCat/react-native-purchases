# react-native-purchases

React Native Purchases is a client for the [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) subscription and purchase tracking system. It is an open source framework that provides a wrapper around `StoreKit`, `Google Play Billing` and the RevenueCat backend to make implementing in-app purchases in `React Native` easy.

## Requirements

The minimum React Native version this SDK requires is `0.58`.

## Installation

ExpoKit projects of version 33 or higher can successfully use react-native-purchases. If you haven't upgraded, you can follow [the instructions here to upgrade](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/expokit/expokit/#upgrading-expokit). 

If you're planning on ejecting from Expo, upgrade your expo version _first_, THEN eject. It'll save you a whole lot of hassle.

### Add the library to the project

`$ npm install react-native-purchases --save`
or
`$ yarn add react-native-purchases`

### Link library to the project

`$ react-native link react-native-purchases`

#### Additional iOS Setup (for manual installation)
Purchases.framework also needs to be added to your iOS project. The npm install will download the correct framework version. 

Alternatively you can install the framework via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Purchases). For instructions go [here](#installing-with-cocoapods--expokit).

##### Create a Framework Reference in your project

1. Drag `Purchases.framework` from the `RNPurchases`sub-project under the libraries section to the outer project and create a reference.

If you're using Expo, you'll need to drag a reference from your `node_modules/react-native-purchases/ios/Purchases.framework` instead.

##### Add iOS Framework to Embedded Binaries
1. In Xcode, in project manager, select your app target.
1. Select the general tab
1. Drag `Purchases.framework` from your project to the Embedded Binaries section

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/dCCyG7rmjIyByLS9ju/giphy.gif)

Add `$(PROJECT_DIR)/../node_modules/react-native-purchases/ios` to Framework Search paths in build settings

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1pAbuARm4TLfZKdfx3/giphy.gif)

##### Add Strip Frameworks Phase
The App Store, in it's infinite wisdom, still rejects fat frameworks, so we need to strip our framework before it is deployed. To do this, add the following script phase to your build.
1. In Xcode, in project manager, select your app target.
2. Open the `Build Phases` tab
3. Add a new `Run Script`, name it `Strip Frameworks`
4. Add the following command `"${PROJECT_DIR}/../node_modules/react-native-purchases/ios/strip-frameworks.sh"` (quotes included)

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/39zTmnsW1CIrJNk5AM/giphy.gif)

##### Link static library
The `react-native link` command should have added the `libRNPurchases.a` library to the _Linked Frameworks and Libraries_ section of your app target. If it hasn't add it like this:

### Installing with Cocoapods / ExpoKit
If your project already uses Cocoapods to install iOS dependencies, common in ExpoKit projects, linking the library should have added it to the podfile. If it hasn't, add the following to your project's podfile to reference the library from your `node_modules` folder:

```
  pod 'RNPurchases', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-purchases'
      :inhibit_warnings => true
```

In your `ios` folder, run `pod install`. If you've just upgraded ExpoKit, you might need to upgrade cocoapods to the newest version: `sudo gem install cocoapods`. 

## Getting Started
For more detailed information, you can view our complete documentation at [docs.revenuecat.com](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs).

#### 1. Get a RevenueCat API key

Log in to the [RevenueCat dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com) and obtain a free API key for your application.

#### 2. Initialize an `RCPurchases` object

You should only configure *Purchases* once (usually on app launch) as soon as your app has a unique user id for your user. This can be when a user logs in if you have accounts or on launch if you can generate a random user identifier. The same instance is shared throughout your app by accessing the `.shared` instance in the SDK.

```javascript
import Purchases from 'react-native-purchases';

Purchases.setDebugLogsEnabled(true);
let purchases = await Purchases.setup("revenuecat_api_key", "app_user_id");
```

#### 3. Displaying Available Products

*Purchases* will automatically fetch the latest *active* entitlements and get the product information from Apple or Google. This means when users launch your purchase screen, products will already be loaded.

Below is an example of fetching entitlements.

```javascript
try {
  const entitlements = await Purchases.getEntitlements();
  this.setState({entitlements});
} catch (e) {

}
```

#### 4. Make a purchase
When it comes time to make a purchase, *Purchases* has a simple method, `makePurchase`. The code sample below shows the process of purchasing a product and confirming it unlocks the *pro* content.

```javascript
try {
  const purchaseMade = await Purchases.makePurchase(entitlements.pro.monthly.identifier);
  if (typeof purchaseMade.purchaserInfo.entitlements.active.my_entitlement_identifier !== "undefined") {
    // Unlock that great "pro" content
  }
} catch (e) {
  if (!e.userCancelled) { 
    showError(e);
  }
}
```

>`makePurchase` handles the underlying framework interaction and automatically validates purchases with Apple and Google through our secure servers. This helps reduce in-app purchase fraud and decreases the complexity of your app. Receipt tokens are stored remotely and always kept up-to-date.

#### 5. Get Subscription Status
*Purchases* makes it easy to check what active subscriptions the current user has. This can be done two ways within the `.purchaserInfo` method:
1. Checking active Entitlements - this lets you see what entitlements ([from RevenueCat dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com)) are active for the user.
2. Checking the active subscriptions - this lets you see what product ids (from iTunes Connect or Play Store) are active for the user.

```javascript
// Get purchaser info
try {
  const purchaserInfo = await Purchases.getPurchaserInfo();
  if(typeof purchaserInfo.entitlements.active.my_entitlement_identifier !== "undefined") {
    // Grant user "pro" access
  }
} catch (e) {
 // Error fetching purchaser info
}
```

>Since the SDK updates and caches the latest PurchaserInfo when the app becomes active, the completion block in `.purchaserInfo` won't need to make a network request in most cases.

##### Listening For Purchaser Info Updates
Since Purchases SDK works seamlessly on any platform, a user's purchase info may change from a variety of sources. You can respond to any changes in purchaser info by conforming to an optional listener. This will fire whenever we receive a change in purchaser info and you should expect it to be called at launch and throughout the life of the app.

Depending on your app, it may be sufficient to ignore the delegate and simply handle changes to purchaser information the next time your app is launched.

```javascript
Purchases.addPurchaserInfoUpdateListener(info => {
  // handle any changes to purchaserInfo
});
```

### Restoring Purchases
Restoring purchases is a mechanism by which your user can restore their in-app purchases, reactivating any content that had previously been purchased from the same store account (Apple or Google).

If two different App User IDs try to restore transactions from the same underlying store account (Apple or Google) RevenueCat will create an alias between the two App User IDs and count them as the same user going forward.

This is a common if your app does not have accounts and is relying on RevenueCat's random App User IDs.

```javascript
try {
  const purchaserInfo = Purchases.restoreTransactions();
} catch (e) {
 // Error restoring
}
```

**Restoring purchases for logged in users:**  
>If you've provided your own App User ID, calling restoreTransactions could alias the logged in user to another generated App User ID that has made a purchase on the same device.

**Allow Sharing App or Play Store Accounts**
>By default, RevenueCat will not let you reuse an App or Play Store account that already has an active subscription. If you set allowSharingAppStoreAccount = True the SDK will be permissive in accepting shared accounts, creating aliases as needed.

>By default allowSharingAppStoreAccount is True for RevenueCat random App User IDs but must be enabled manually if you want to allow permissive sharing for your own App User IDs.

## Debugging
You can enabled detailed debug logs by setting `debugLogsEnabled = true`. You can set this **before** you configure Purchases.

```javascript
Purchases.setDebugLogsEnabled(true);
```

**OS_ACTIVITY_MODE**
>On iOS, disabling `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` in your XCode scheme will block debug logs from printing in the console. If you have debug logs enabled, but don't see any output, go to `Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme...` in Xcode and uncheck the `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE` environment variable.

Example output:
```
[Purchases] - DEBUG: Debug logging enabled.
[Purchases] - DEBUG: SDK Version - 2.0.0
[Purchases] - DEBUG: Initial App User ID - (null)
[Purchases] - DEBUG: GET /v1/subscribers/<APP_USER_ID>
[Purchases] - DEBUG: GET /v1/subscribers/<APP_USER_ID>/products
[Purchases] - DEBUG: No cached entitlements, fetching
[Purchases] - DEBUG: Vending purchaserInfo from cache
[Purchases] - DEBUG: applicationDidBecomeActive
[Purchases] - DEBUG: GET /v1/subscribers/<APP_USER_ID>/products 200
```

## Entitlements
An entitlement represents features or content that a user is "entitled" to. With Entitlements, you can set up your available in-app products remotely and control their availability without the need to update your app. For more information on configuring entitlements, look at our [entitlements documentation](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements).

## Sample App
We've added an example in this project showing a simple example using *Purchases* with the RevenueCat backend. Note that the pre-registered in app purchases in the demo apps are for illustration purposes only and may not be valid in App Store Connect. [Set up your own purchases](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/entitlements) with RevenueCat when running the example.
