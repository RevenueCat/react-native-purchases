## React Native Purchases

React Native Purchases is the client for the [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) subscription and purchase tracking system. It is an open source framework that provides a wrapper around `StoreKit`, `Google Play Billing` and the RevenueCat backend to make implementing in-app purchases in `React Native` easy.

## Installation

Expo supports in-app payments and is compatible with `react-native-purchases`. To use the SDK, [create a new project](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) and set up a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build). Development builds enable native code and provide a complete environment for testing purchases.

```
$ npx expo install react-native-purchases
```

In Expo Go, the SDK automatically runs in **Preview API Mode**, replacing native calls with JavaScript mocks so your app loads without errors. Real purchases, however, require a development build.

### Using development builds

To fully test in-app purchases, you’ll need to create a [custom development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) with EAS. This ensures that all native dependencies, including `react-native-purchases`, are properly included.
