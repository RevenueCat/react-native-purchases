## React Native Purchases

React Native Purchases is the client for the [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com/) subscription and purchase tracking system. It is an open source framework that provides a wrapper around `StoreKit`, `Google Play Billing` and the RevenueCat backend to make implementing in-app purchases in `React Native` easy.

## Installation

Expo supports in-app payments and is compatible with react-native-purchases. To use the library, [create a new project](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-project/) and set up a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?mode=development-build). A development build helps you iterate quickly and provides a complete development environment. After you've created the project, install the library:

```
$ npx expo install react-native-purchases
```

### Bare workflow
If you are using [bare workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/overview/) (that is, your project is created using `react-native init`), [install `expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) into your project and [leverage Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/using-expo-cli/) to use Expo tooling and services.
