## 5.0.0-beta.1

⚠️⚠️ This is a pre-release version. ⚠️⚠️

#### StoreKit 2 support
This version of the SDK automatically uses StoreKit 2 APIs under the hood only for APIs that the RevenueCat team has determined work better than StoreKit 1.

#### New types and cleaned up naming
New types that wrap native types from Apple, Google and Amazon, and we cleaned up the naming of other types and methods for a more consistent experience. 

### Removed APIs
- `setUp` has been removed in favor of `configure`
- `identify` and `createAlias` have been removed in favor of `logIn`.
- `reset` has been removed in favor of `logOut`.
- `addAttributionData` has been removed in favor of `set<NetworkID> methods`.
- `PurchasesStoreProduct`: removed `intro_price_string`, `intro_price_period`, `intro_price_cycles`, `intro_price_period_unit`, `intro_price_period_number_of_units` in favor of new `introPrice: PurchasesIntroPrice`.

### Renamed APIs

| 4.x | 5.0.0 |
| :-: | :-: |
| `PurchaserInfo` | `CustomerInfo` |
| `PurchasesProduct` | `PurchasesStoreProduct` |
| `PurchasesStoreProductProduct.price_string` | `PurchasesStoreProductProduct.priceString` |
| `PurchasesStoreProductProduct.currency_code` | `PurchasesStoreProductProduct.currencyCode` |
| `PurchasesTransaction` | `PurchasesStoreTransaction` |
| `PurchasesDiscount` | `PurchasesStoreProductDiscount` |
| `PurchasesPaymentDiscount` | `PurchasesPromotionalOffer` |
| `Purchases.restoreTransactions` | `Purchases.restorePurchases` |
| `Purchases.getPaymentDiscount` | `Purchases.getPromotionalOffer` |
| `Purchases.invalidatePurchaserInfoCache` | `Purchases.invalidateCustomerInfoCache` |
| `Purchases.addPurchaserInfoUpdateListener` | `Purchases.addCustomerInfoUpdateListener` |

## 4.5.0

This release has some changes that should help prevent "There is no singleton instance" errors [issue](https://github.com/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases/issues/101), [PR](https://github.com/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases/pull/310).
- Added `isConfigured` function to be able to check if the instance of Purchases has been configured before calling any function that accesses the singleton instance.
- These functions that were returning `void`, now return `Promise<void>`: 

| Integrations         | Subscriber attributes      | Configuration and other |

| `setOnesignalID`     |                            |                 |

### Identity V3:

#### Deprecations
- deprecates `createAlias` in favor of `logIn`.
- deprecates `identify` in favor of `logIn`.
- deprecates `reset` in favor of `logOut`.
